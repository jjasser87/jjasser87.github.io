# Illuminatio

This past March, I finally had the chance to experiment with [SUNO](https://suno.com). Composing music isn’t new to me; I’ve been doing it as a hobby since my college days, testing and experimenting with different Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs). I initially used [FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com), then tried [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/) and [Cubase](https://www.steinberg.net/cubase/), but stuck with FL Studio because I found it easier to work with than the other two. After purchasing a Mac, I used [GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/) alongside FL Studio. However, composing with AI is a different story, and I was eager to explore it from the perspective of collaboration rather than asking the AI the create an entire song in one shot.

For this project, I used six songs I made almost two decades ago using FL Studio. I uploaded them to SUNO and started extending, replacing, and cutting them. When I was done, I had an entire album that’s over 40 minutes long! It took me less than a week to make the album, but it took the whole summer to polish it. I made around 1000 samples to replace sections I didn’t like. To be precise, 977 samples. I kept some sections untouched to preserve the original samples I made, which made the editing process even harder. I also did some final minor edits using [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org).

So, *Illuminatio* is finally out! You can download the WAV files in high-resolution using this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mDuL-QbjgvFdOf3aLoL_eTagJVxX3j-J?usp=share_link). Or, if you prefer, you can access it on [SUNO](https://suno.com/playlist/3485c42f-4b64-4a8a-a357-f6f775c067dc) where you can copy and modify it. And if you just want to listen to it, you can find it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2Q2G0yyL3h3AzUTuAP2ZJe?si=AL45UOQpRF2m0UYUTfDyGQ), Apple Music (coming soon), and all other streaming services.

Enjoy…
