## **Summary**

I am a Data Scientist and Lecturer with a PhD in Computer Science, committed to unraveling the complexities of information diffusion and online behavior. By leveraging advanced analytics on large-scale social network datasets, I uncover the motivations behind how content spreads and shapes digital communities. As a faculty member at Rollins College, I provide students with hands-on experience in data analytics fundamentals, machine learning, and social network analysis—equipping them to thrive in our data-driven world.
